///////////////////////////////x86_N64: 1.0v///////////////////////////////////
English:

This is a medium project that I started out of the desire to play Zelda's
Majoras Mask. Unable to run a emulator in my linux laptop, i decided to
fix my problem while testing how much can i actually do.

The idea is to adapt a real N64 to my needs (ie: running roms, being able to
usemy monitor, etc) using the microprocessor of an old pc that i had laying
around, basically, i'm writting some kind of basic OS to this end.

For the moment, there is only a small assambler file that is written to 
a MBR, and display one of to massage deppending on the keypord input.
